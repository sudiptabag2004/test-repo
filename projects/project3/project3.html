                    <span class="cw-label">What is the primary goal of AgroAid?</span>
                    <div class="cw-acordion-cont">
                        <p>The primary goal of AgroAid is to contribute to proactive agriculture by identifying plant diseases at an early stage. This early detection is critical for farmers, as it enables timely intervention, preventing potential crop loss and ensuring food security. The classifier is designed to analyze images of plant leaves, offering a quick and precise assessment of their health. By distinguishing between various disease classes and healthy leaves within each plant category, AgroAid empowers farmers with valuable insights to optimize crop yields and maintain the overall quality of agricultural produce.</p>

                    <span class="cw-label">What is the technology stack used in making AgroAid?</span>
                    <div class="cw-acordion-cont">
                        <p>the technology stack used in developing AgroAid includes:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Machine Learning Framework: TensorFlow and Keras are utilized for building and training the machine learning models, particularly for transfer learning with the pre-trained ResNet50 model.</li>
                            <li>Data Manipulation and Processing: NumPy is employed for efficient handling of numerical operations and data manipulation.</li>
                            <li>Image Processing: OpenCV (cv2) is used for image processing tasks, which is crucial for working with plant leaf images in the dataset.</li>
                            <li>Visualization: Matplotlib is utilized for creating visualizations, which can be essential for understanding the model's performance and the characteristics of the dataset.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This technology stack aligns with standard practices in machine learning and computer vision applications. Additionally, since the project involves training and evaluating models on a Kaggle dataset, it suggests a practical approach to leveraging existing datasets for developing solutions in agriculture, specifically in the identification of plant diseases through image classification.</p>

                <article class="cw-accordion__item">
                    <span class="cw-label">How frequently should I use AgroAid to check my plants for diseases?</span>
                    <div class="cw-acordion-cont">
                        <p>The frequency of using AgroAid depends on various factors, including the growth stage of your plants, environmental conditions, and the specific diseases prevalent in your region. As a general guideline, regular monitoring, especially during critical growth stages, is recommended. It's advisable to use AgroAid whenever you observe changes in leaf appearance or suspect potential issues. Early detection is crucial, so periodic checks, especially during the growing season, can help ensure timely intervention and maintain plant health.</p>

                    <span class="cw-label">Can AgroAid identify diseases in other types of plants besides pepper, potato, and tomato?</span>
                    <div class="cw-acordion-cont">
                        <p>Currently, AgroAid is tailored to identify diseases in pepper, potato, and tomato plants. The model is trained specifically for these crops and may not provide accurate results for other plant types. To achieve optimal performance, AgroAid is designed to focus on the unique characteristics of these three crops and their associated diseases. For different plants, a separate model trained on a relevant dataset would be needed to ensure accurate disease identification.</p>

                    <div class="cw-acordion-cont">
                        <p>AgroAid is like a smart helper for farmers. It uses computer smarts to look at pictures of plant leaves and figure out if they're healthy or if they have a problem, like a disease. Imagine it's like having a quick and clever assistant that can tell farmers early on if their plants need some extra care. It's all about using technology to keep crops safe, so farmers can grow more and better food for everyone.</p>
