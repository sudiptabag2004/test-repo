                    <div class="cw-acordion-cont">
                        <p>In the era of e-commerce, prices of products can fluctuate rapidly. Having the ability to
                            track these changes
                            can provide consumers with valuable insights to make informed purchasing decisions. This is
                            where
                            TrackHub, a Price Tracking Web ApplicaBon, comes into play. Built using Next.js, a powerful
                            React
                            framework, TrackHub leverages mulBple dependencies for web scraping to track the prices of
                            various
                            products across different online plaIorms.

                <article class="cw-accordion__item">
                    <span class="cw-label">What are the features of TrackHub?</span>
                    <div class="cw-acordion-cont">
                        <p>Features of TrackHub include :</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Price Tracking: One of the core features of TrackHub is its ability to track the
                                highest, lowest, and average prices of a
                                product. This feature is powered by web scraping tools such as Bright Data and Cheerio,
                                which extract pricing data from various online plaIorms. The data is then processed and analysed to
                                determine the price trends. <br> This feature not only allows users to understand the price trends but also enables them to predict future price movements. By understanding when the prices are likely to rise or fall, users can plan their purchases accordingly and potenBally save a significant amount of money</li>
                            <li>User Registration: TrackHub offers users the facility to register for certain products.
                                This means that users can select specific products that they are interested in, and TrackHub will focus on tracking the prices of these products. The registration information is stored securely in a MongoDB ATLAS database. This ensures data integrity and security, as the user data is protected from unauthorized access and corruption. The use of MongoDB ATLAS also provides scalability, allowing TrackHub to handle increasing amounts of data as more users register for products.</li>
                            <li>Email Notifications: TrackHub goes beyond just tracking prices - it also keeps users informed through email notifications. This feature is one of the key highlights of TrackHub, enhancing the user experience by providing Bmely and relevant information. <br> When the price of a registered product drops to its lowest or if an out-of-stock product comes back in stock, TrackHub automaBcally sends an email noBficaBon to the user. This ensures that users do not miss out on any potenBal deals or restocks. The email service is powered by NodeMailer, which is known for its reliability and efficiency.

                    <span class="cw-label">What is the technology stack used in making TrackHub?</span>
                    <div class="cw-acordion-cont">
                        <p>TrackHub utilizes a robust technology stack to deliver its features :</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Frontend: The frontend of TrackHub is built using Next.js, a powerful React framework. This allows
                                for a dynamic and responsive user interface, enhancing the user experience.</li>
                            <li>Backend: The backend operaBons are handled by Node.js, known for its efficiency and scalability.
                                This ensures that TrackHub can handle a large number of requests and operate smoothly.</li>
                            <li>Database: TrackHub uses MongoDB ATLAS for its database needs. This provides a secure and
                                scalable soluBon for storing user registraBon data. </li>
                            <li>Web Scraping: TrackHub leverages mulBple dependencies for web scraping, including Bright Data
                                and Cheerio. These tools extract pricing data from various online plaIorms, which is then used for
                                price tracking.</li>
                            <li>Email Service: The email noBficaBons feature is powered by NodeMailer, which is used for sending
                                emails to registered users when there are significant price changes or restocks.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                <article class="cw-accordion__item">
                    <span class="cw-label">What differenciates TrackHub from other similar websites?</span>
                    <div class="cw-acordion-cont">
                        <p>One of the key features that make TrackHub a powerful tool is its use of Cron Jobs for automated price
                            checking. Cron Jobs are scheduled tasks that run at fixed intervals. In the context of TrackHub, they are
                            used to check the prices of products at regular intervals.
                            Here’s how it works:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Scheduled Price Checking: TrackHub uses Cron Jobs to automaBcally check the prices of registered
                                    products at fixed intervals. This could be every hour, every day, or any other interval that suits the
                                    needs of the applicaBon. This ensures that the price data is always up-to-date, even if the prices
                                    change frequently</li>
                                <li>Automated Email Updates: When the Cron Job runs and checks the prices, it also checks if there
                                    have been any significant updates. For example, if a product has dropped to its lowest price ever, or
                                    if an out-of-stock product is back in stock. If such an update is detected, TrackHub automaBcally
                                    sends an email noBficaBon to the user. This means that users are always informed about important
                                    updates, without having to manually check the website.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <p> This combination of automated price checking and email noBficaBons makes TrackHub a convenient and
                            powerful tool for tracking product prices. Users can set up their preferences and then let TrackHub do the
                            work, confident that they will be noBfied about the best deals and restocks. This feature, powered by Cron
                            Jobs, is a testament to TrackHub’s commitment to providing a user-friendly and efficient price tracking
                            solution.</p>
