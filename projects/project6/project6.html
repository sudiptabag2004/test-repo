                    <div class="cw-acordion-cont">
                        <p>Fine-Tuned LLM is a project that involves refining the capabilities of the Llama2 language model to provide precise and informed responses to technical queries about electrical substations. The fine-tuning process includes the generation of a custom dataset using the OpenAI API, comprising diverse prompt/response pairs related to substation topics. Through rigorous training and testing, the Llama2 model is adapted to exhibit enhanced knowledge and accuracy in addressing substation-related inquiries. The culmination of this effort is the creation of the "llama-2-7b-custom" model, which seamlessly integrates the robust language understanding of Llama2 with specialized knowledge specific to electrical substations. Fine-Tuned LLM thus represents a sophisticated language model tailored for excellence in the domain of substation-related information.

                    <span class="cw-label">What is the Fine Tuned LLM made of?</span>
                    <div class="cw-acordion-cont">
                        <p>
                            Fine-Tuned LLM is comprised of two key components:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Llama2 Model: The foundation of Fine-Tuned LLM is the Llama2 language model. Llama2 is a sophisticated pre-existing language model, likely developed by OpenAI. It possesses advanced natural language processing capabilities and general knowledge. In this project, Llama2 serves as the starting point for fine-tuning, providing a baseline understanding of language and context.</li>
                            <li>Custom Dataset: The fine-tuning process involves the creation of a custom dataset specifically tailored to electrical substation topics. This dataset is generated using the OpenAI API and includes diverse prompt/response pairs related to substation queries. The custom dataset serves as the training material for the Llama2 model, allowing it to adapt and specialize in providing accurate and contextually relevant information about electrical substations.</li>
                            <p>The Fine-Tuned LLM project utilizes a technology stack that facilitates the process of fine-tuning the Llama2 model and generating accurate responses to electrical substation queries:</p>
                            <li>Jupyter Notebook: Jupyter Notebook serves as the primary development environment for the project. Its interactive and versatile nature makes it suitable for managing the code, data exploration, and documenting the fine-tuning process.</li>
                            <li>Python: Python, a powerful programming language, plays a crucial role in scripting and implementing the fine-tuning process. With 5.3% of the technology stack dedicated to Python, it is likely used for interfacing with the OpenAI API, dataset manipulation, and model training.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The combination of Jupyter Notebook and Python provides an effective and flexible environment for the development, fine-tuning, and testing phases of the Fine-Tuned LLM project. This technology stack ensures a streamlined workflow, allowing for efficient experimentation and adaptation of the language model to the specific requirements of electrical substation queries.</p>
